## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3 properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries

### What I learned

I revised the concepts of flexbox and media queries.

### Continued development

As I was doing the project I realised that practicing is really helping me in reinforcing what I've learnt. Another thing I realised was that I have not really understood the concept of media query in application. I am going to work on media queries and practicing more.
